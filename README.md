# project_TicTacToe

This TicTacToe project was made using module pattern in JS. I learned a lot
about this pattern in doing this; 

It felt really hard at start, but as i gave it
some thought and time, I found the way through the tunnel.

## What I learnt :
Using Module Pattern

Using IIFEs

Using Factory Functions
